## Alternatives to Multithreading

Due to the limitations imposed by the GIL, consider the following alternatives for CPU-bound tasks:

    - **Multiprocessing:** Use the multiprocessing module to create separate processes which can run on multiple CPU cores.
    - **Asyncio:** For I/O-bound tasks, the asyncio module provides a single-threaded cooperative multitasking approach.
